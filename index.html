                <li><strong>1895</strong> - Legend 1: On Christmas Day, a French patissier named Louis Dufour ran out of ideas for Christmas treats to sell, so he made a batch of ganache, 
                    shape it into round balls, and then dipped them into melted chocolate, followed by rolling them in cocoa powder.</li>
                <li><strong>1902</strong> - Antoine Dufour, a relative of Louis Dufour, immigrated to England, bringing the family’s truffle shop to use at his shop in London: Pestat Chocolate Shop.</li>
                <li><strong>1920s</strong> - Legend 2: An apprentice of French cooking giant, Auguste Escoffier. The apprentice made a mistake of pouring hot cream to a bowl of chunks of chocolate, making ganache. 
                    When the ganache hardened, he shaped it into balls then rolled them is cocoa powders. </li>
                <li><strong>1820s</strong> - The earliest known authentic recipe for chocolate truffles was printed in the 19’s edition of Rigby’s Reliable Candy Teacher by W.O. Rigby. 
                    In his version, the balls are rolled in coconut instead of cocoa powder. </li>
